## Effectiveness
- **accuracy** and **completeness** with which users **achieve** specified goals [1, Sec. 3.1347][2, Sec. 4.2]
- extent to which **planned** activities are **realized** and planned results **achieved** [3, Sec. 3.1.3]
- relation of the goals of using the product to the accuracy and completeness with which these goals might be achieved [4, Sec. 3.14]
### Eg: 
- For documentation, common measures include percentage of task completion, frequency of defects, frequency of assists, frequency of accesses to help or documentation.


## Efficiency
- degree to which a system or component performs its designated functions with minimum consumption of resources
- resources expended in relation to the accuracy and completeness with which users achieve goals [1, Sec. 3.1349][2, Sec. 4.3]
- relation of the level of effectiveness achieved to the quantity of resources expended [1, Sec. 3.1349][4, Sec. 3.15]
- relationship between the result achieved and the resources used [5, Sec. 4.17]
